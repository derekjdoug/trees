## Lessons Learned

- Fun exercise, and actually a lot more simple than I thought it would be. I haven't had much experience with recursion, so I'm going to spend some time going over this code with a fine-toothed comb. The order of everthing/using the function across classes is something that I also want to investigate more. I'm excited to take the next step and use this with a tree that isn't binary.

- BST implementation was a little bit tougher. Honestly, a silly thing I struggle with is when/what line to return something on. Not anything a little experimentation couldn't fix and was good practice in that regard. I probably have a few bugs that could arise from this code, but for now it is all passing.
