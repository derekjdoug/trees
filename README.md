## Lessons Learned

- Fun exercise, and actually a lot more simple than I thought it would be. I haven't had much experience with recursion, so I'm going to spend some time going over this code with a fine-toothed comb. The order of everthing/using the function across classes is something that I also want to investigate more. I'm excited to take the next step and use this with a tree that isn't binary.
